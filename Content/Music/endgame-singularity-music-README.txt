The "music/" subdirectory of this package should be moved into your
Endgame: Singularity installation directory (if it does not already
exist). Any additional tracks dropped in there will be played
randomly as part of the soundtrack.  Note that Pygame support for
MP3s is not as solid as its support for Ogg Vorbis, and adding MP3s
to the soundtrack may cause the game to crash.  File formats other
than Ogg Vorbis and MP3 are not supported.

Thanks to Max McCracken for providing these tunes!  They are
released under the same BY-SA 3.0 license as the Psycle and Renoise
source files for the tracks, which can be found in the main Endgame:
Singularity distribution.
